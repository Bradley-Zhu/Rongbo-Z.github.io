# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in [Industrial & Operations Engineering (IOE)](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. Raed Al Kontar](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/al-kontar-raed/).

My research interest lies broadly in statistical learning, generative models such as diffusion models, reinforcement learning, and their applications.

# Papers in Progress

- **Zhu, R.**, Manopanjasiri, P., Shi, N., Sun, Q., Al Kontar, R.(2025) "Collaborative & Federated Conditional-Based Maintenance" 

- **Zhu, R.**, Al Kontar, R. (2025)  "Iterative Reinforcement Learning for Inference Time Adaptation of Diffusion Models"

# News

- October 2025: I'll present at 2025 Informs Annual Meeting on the topic of iterative reinforcement learning for inference time adaptation of diffusion models.
